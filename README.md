# DESCRIPTION OF TASK LIKE HOW YOU PERFORMED AND WHAT DONE AND PASTE PICTURES OF OUTPUT:
I have collected the basic information and gained the knowledge regarding to the task and the task is home automation with ir controller week I have learned about the importance of home automation with IR controlled
Home Automation with IR Remote and Arduino allows you to control devices like lights or fans using any regular TV remote. This is a beginner-friendly project that uses an IR sensor to receive signals and control relays accordingly all the basic concept was understood
The week began with studying the working principles of IR (Infrared) sensors and relay modules. learned how an IR sensor detects objects by sensing reflected infrared light and how a relay acts as an electrically operated switch to control higher power devices. This helped to understand the role these components play in automated systems.
Used Fritzing software to create circuit diagrams representing the Arduino, IR sensor, and relay connections. This helped me visualize the wiring clearly and provided a platform to simulate and verify the circuit design before actual hardware implementation. The use of Fritzing improved my circuit design skills.
Studied the basic Arduino functions such as digitalRead(), digitalWrite(), analogRead(), Arduino board, enabling interaction with sensors and actuators. This theoretical knowledge is crucial for writing effective Arduino programs. 
In a home automation system, the IR remote acts as a wireless controller for turning devices ON or OFF.through that I   gained  knowledge how to operate  lights, fans, TVs, etc., from a distance. You donâ€™t have to touch the switchboard. No internet or Bluetooth required. Works in areas without network connectivity.all the basic information is understaned about the IR remote
Finally based on the knowledge of all the days in the week implemented the task of home automation with IR controller
Understand the basic concept of the home autommation with the IR controller
Learned to design and simulate IR sensor and relay interfacing with Arduino using Fritzing software
Understood and applied basic Arduino functions: analogRead, analogWrite,digitalRead, digitalWrite, and pinMode.
Understand the importance of the IR remote
Implemented and executed the home automation with IR remote
